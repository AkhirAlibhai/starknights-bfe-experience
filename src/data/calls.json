Oh don't be silly darling, I don't even acknowledge traffic.  Traffic acknowledges me.  Besides, how could you let traffic stop you from getting to what is undoubtedly going to be the best night of your life?  I mean, I bet you've never even seen the inside of a McDonalds.  Oh, speaking of, I went ahead and ordered you the Happy Meal because - let's face it - someone of your stature doesn't really need that much food.  Where would the calories go?  Certainly not your chest, am I right? Ha!  Hurry hurry, and I'll see you soon, cupcake."

Yeah, that beauty. First off, you have impeccable taste. This thing’s a marvel of pseudo-engineering, designed to modulate the spurving bearings with unparalleled finesse. But, uh, here’s the deal: we hit a bit of a snag during the final quality check. Seems the hydrocoptic marzelvanes got a little too… enthusiastic and started over-synchronizing with the differential girdlespring. Long story short, the ambifacient lunar waneshaft threw a fit and started emitting non-standard flux harmonics—think ‘angry theremin at a sci-fi convention.’ It’s not catastrophic, but it’s definitely not hitting the 47.3% efficiency spec for retroflux capacitance. Don’t panic! Our team’s already elbow-deep in recalibrating the logarithmic casing and rerouting the spurving flux through a secondary grommet array. We’ll have it purring like a quantum kitten in no time. I’ll shoot you an update once we’ve pacified the waneshaft. Call me back if you’ve got questions—My number is 808 420 5000"
